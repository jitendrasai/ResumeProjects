Research Questions

The three research questions being explored in this project are,

1. Predict whether a developer’s issue will be resolved based on the initial prompt with ChatGPT?
2. Based on the initial Prompt we will predict whether the given question will take high conversations or Low conversations to resolve the issue. ( For example if a question takes more than four prompts then we will assume that it will take more conversations to resolve the issue).
3. Based on the Initial prompt we will predict the given question belongs to which type of programming language (Python/Java/C/C++) and analyze in which type of programming language-related questions were mostly asked by developers to ChatGPT

Project Structure
- `Data Extraction.py` this is the code used to extract the json data into csv.
- In `DATASET` we have have snapshots and datasets for 3 questions
- `Question 1`, `Question 2` and `Question 3` are the folders that contains code for respective questions.


Steps to run the Code :

1) open the files with visual studio code
2) Install python in vscode
3) install all the necessary packages that needed to execute the codes.
4) Run all block of code from the top.
